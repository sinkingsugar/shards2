# Authoring eval

Spec: [docs/golden-path.md §8](../../docs/golden-path.md). It measures how well a model writes Shards from a reference alone, so syntax and API disputes are settled with data (decision D12).

## Pieces

- `tasks/*.task`: small tasks, each with a `prompt`, the `expected` log lines and a hidden `reference` solution. `cargo test -p authoring-eval` runs every reference in-process and requires exactly the expected log, so the tasks stay solvable as the language changes (M2 rewrites the references with the rest of the suite). The tree-fold task arrives with recursion (M7).
- `reference/<variant>.md`: the language primer for a syntax variant. The model gets the primer followed by `shards2 catalog` and `shards2 describe` for every shard (`authoring-eval reference` prints it). `current` is the pre-M2 syntax; keep it after M2. `functions` is the M2 plus M5 syntax (assignment forms, lowercase labels, `Keep`, exhaustive `Match`, `@fn`). A later variant's primer changes only what its syntax requires, so a difference in results is the syntax's, not the primer's.
- `src/main.rs`: the runner. It shells out to a model command; there is no embedded API client.

## Running

Build `shards2` first (`cargo build --release -p shards-cli`; the runner needs `run --json`), then:

```sh
cargo run -p authoring-eval -- verify    # reference solutions through the real CLI

cargo run -p authoring-eval -- run --model sonnet --format claude-json \
  --cmd 'claude -p --model sonnet --output-format json --tools "" --setting-sources "" --strict-mcp-config' \
  --out results.csv --transcripts transcripts/sonnet

cargo run -p authoring-eval -- run --model codex --format text \
  --cmd 'codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox read-only -' --out results.csv
```

The prompt goes to the command's stdin, from an empty temporary directory, so the model sees only the prompt; disable tools where the CLI allows it. The command runs in its own process group, killed when it exits or after 10 minutes. Per task: the model's last complete fenced code block is checked with `shards2 check --json`; diagnostics go back for at most `--rounds` repairs (default 5); a program that checks is run with `shards2 run --json`, which must succeed and log exactly the expected lines. `--only TEXT` selects tasks whose id contains the text, `--jobs N` runs tasks in parallel (default 4), `--trials N` repeats each task.

Pass a full model ID or use `claude-json`, which records the resolved model. To compare a new syntax variant with `current` on the same model and day, rerun `current` with a `shards2` built from the tag `authoring-control-v1` (`--shards2 path/to/that/shards2`), the last control before M2 changes the syntax.

## Results

One CSV row per (task, model, variant, trial): `ModelId` (what the CLI reported, `claude-json` only), `SemanticSuccess` (the log matched), `FirstPassSuccess` (the first reply checked clean), `FirstFailure` (the class of that first failure), `RepairRounds`, `Tokens` and `OutputTokens` (summed over rounds, `claude-json` only; `Tokens` is dominated by the fixed prompt, about 16k tokens of reference plus about 7k of the CLI's system prompt a call, so compare `OutputTokens`), `LatencyMs` (model time only) and `Failure`. Failure classes: `syntax` (parse errors), `missing-shard` (an unknown shard), `compose` (other check errors), `format` (no complete code block in the reply), `runtime`, `wrong-output`, `timeout`, `model-error` and `harness-error` (the runner's own step failed; the transcript says why).

Each run lives in `results/<date>-<what>/` (`results.csv` and `transcripts/`). The pre-M2 baseline is `results/2026-10-06-baseline` (Sonnet and Haiku, 3 trials each). `results/2026-10-06-sonnet-primer-v1` is the first Sonnet run, superseded (first primer, alias only, one trial; its `FirstFailure` values were filled in from the transcripts, and `ModelId` and `OutputTokens` were not recorded). Commit rows from real runs only, never mock or placeholder data. Small samples are evidence, not proof.
