# Shards language reference (functions syntax)

A program is a pipeline of **shards**. Each shard receives the previous shard's output as its input and produces an output. `|` separates shards and is optional: `1 | Log` and `1 Log` mean the same.

```shards
// Line comments start with //.
7 | Math.Add(5) | Math.Multiply(3) | Log   // logs 36
```

## Values

- `Int` (`42`, `-3`), `Float` (`1.5`, `2.0`, `1e3`; write `1.0`, never `1.`), `Bool` (`true`, `false`), `String` (`"text"`), `none`.
- Sequences: `[1 2 3]`. Commas are optional.
- Tables: `{name: "ann" age: 41}`. Reading a missing key with a constant key (`t.missing`, `Take("missing")`) is a compile error. `Take` with a key in a variable outputs the value or `none` (`Int | None` here), so narrow it with `ExpectInt` and friends before arithmetic.
- Float vectors: `[1.0 2.0] | ToFloat2`, `[1.0 2.0 3.0] | ToFloat3`.
- A literal on its own is a shard that outputs that value.
- Arithmetic on two Ints gives an Int, and integer division truncates (`7 | Math.Divide(2)` is `3`); an Int mixed with a Float gives a Float. Convert with `ToFloat` and `ToInt`.
- `f"{name} is {age | Math.Add(1)}"` builds a string; each `{...}` holds a pipeline. Plain `"..."` strings keep braces literal.

## Shards and parameters

Shard names start with an uppercase letter. Parameters go in parentheses, positionally or by name, and labels are lowercase: `Repeat({...} times: 3)`, `Log("label")`. A parameter can be a literal, a variable, or a **flow** in braces `{...}`, as each shard's catalog entry lists under `forms`. A flow receives the shard's input unless the shard says otherwise. Some shards have short aliases (`Add` for `Math.Add`); the catalog lists them.

## Variables

Variable names are lowercase and may contain `-` (`max-speed`), so `a-1` is a name, not a subtraction.

| Write | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `value = x` | declare an immutable variable `x` |
| `value \| Var(x)` | declare a mutable variable `x` |
| `value \| Update(x)` | assign to an existing mutable variable |
| `value \| Push(xs)` | append `value` as one element to the mutable sequence `xs` (declare it first: `[] \| Var(xs)`) |
| `Keep(x 0)` | declare persistent mutable state `x` with a literal initial value, kept across iterations (only at the top level of a wire or a stateful function) |
| `x` | read a variable: outputs its value |
| `x.key`, `xs.0`, `t.a.1` | read a table key or sequence index |

Assignments pass their input through. A name cannot be declared twice while visible (no shadowing); a variable declared inside a flow is visible only inside it. `input` is reserved: it names the entry value of the enclosing function or wire.

```shards
0 | Var(total)
[3 8 1] = xs
0 | Var(i)
Repeat({ xs | Take(i) | Math.Add(total) | Update(total)  Inc(i) } times: 3)
total | Log   // logs 12
```

## Control flow

- `If({predicate} {then} {else})`, or labeled: `If(predicate: {...} then: {...} else: {...})`. The predicate flow outputs a Bool.
- `When({predicate} {action})`, `While({predicate} {action})`, `Repeat({action} times: n)`, `Repeat({action} until: {condition})`, `Repeat({action} forever: true)`.
- `All(a b)` and `Any(a b)` combine conditions (Bool variables, literals or flows), with short-circuit; `Not` negates a Bool.
- `Match([1 {"one"} 2 {"two"}] default: {"other"})`: runs the first case equal to the input. `Match` must cover every value of its input type, or have `default:`; `default: {}` outputs the input.
- `Maybe({action} {fallback} silent: true)`: runs the fallback flow if the action fails.
- `Once({...})` runs its flow only on the first activation of the wire or stateful function instance.
- `Stop` ends the current wire instance. `Return` ends the enclosing function (or wire iteration) with its input as the output.

## Functions

A function is declared at the top level with its signature and called like a shard, by name, with its parameters as labeled arguments. It sees only its input, its parameters and what it declares; it never sees the caller's variables.

```shards
@fn(Scale input: Float output: Float params: {factor: Float} {
  Math.Multiply(factor)
})
3.0 | Scale(factor: 2.0) | Log   // logs 6
```

- `input:` and `output:` are types (`Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Bool`, `None`, `Any`, `[Int]`, `{x: Int y: Int}`, `Int | None`). `input: None` means the function ignores its input. `params: {}` declares no parameters; a literal instead of a type (`params: {step: 1}`) is a default.
- Inside the body, a parameter is an immutable variable of the same name, and `input` is the value the call received.
- A function starts with fresh variables on every call. `stateful: true` makes each call site keep its own instance, so `Keep` and `Once` work inside: `@fn(Counter stateful: true input: None output: Int params: {step: Int} { Keep(n 0) n | Math.Add(step) | Update(n) })` logs 1, 2, 3 when called repeatedly from the same place.
- Mesh variables (declared by the host) are visible in a function only when listed in `uses: [name]` (reads) and `mutates: [name]` (writes).
- A function may not call itself, directly or indirectly.

## Wires, meshes and scheduling

Without `@run`, code at the top level runs once, as the wire `root`. With `@run`, the top level only declares: put code in wires and schedule them. Named wires are declared with `@wire` and spawned (`Spawn`) or scheduled on a mesh.

```shards
@wire(ticker {
  Keep(n 0)                                  // state kept across iterations
  Inc(n) | Log
} looped: true)                              // one iteration per tick
@mesh(main)
@schedule(main ticker)
@run(main iterations: 3)                     // run the mesh for 3 ticks (logs 1, 2, 3); fps: 60 sets the rate
```

- `Spawn(wire)` starts a new independent instance of a wire with the current input as its input.
- A looped wire yields to the scheduler after each iteration, so it runs one iteration per tick. `Pause` suspends until the next tick, so a `Pause` inside a looped wire makes that iteration take an extra tick. `Pause(0.5)` waits at least half a second.
- `@run` runs until every scheduled wire finishes, or for `iterations` ticks.

## Running

`shards2 check file.shs` reports problems with their location; `shards2 run file.shs` runs the program. `Log` writes its input as one line (`Log("label")` writes `label: value`). After the log, `shards2 run` prints each top-level or scheduled wire's result (`root: 36`); these result lines are not part of a task's expected output.
