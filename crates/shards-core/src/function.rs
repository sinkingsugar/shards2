//! Script functions (golden path §3 to §5): a definition owns shared,
//! immutable compiled code; a call site holds argument code and a reference
//! to the compiled body; an invocation owns a private frame.
//!
//! A definition is composed once per input type (`ComposeCache`), against
//! its declared signature: parameters are immutable locals of the body's
//! frame, `input` is the reserved entry binding, and mesh variables are
//! visible only when declared in `uses` or `mutates`. The engine
//! (`stackless/engine.rs`) allocates a stateless invocation's frame at entry
//! and frees it at exit; a stateful call site keeps its frame, and only its
//! `Keep` slots and native state survive between invocations.
