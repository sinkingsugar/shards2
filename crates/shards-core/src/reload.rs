//! Reload policy for functions (golden path §11).
//!
//! A call site selects the newest accepted body at invocation entry; an
//! invocation in flight finishes on the body it started with. A candidate
//! body is admitted only if its input, output and parameters match what the
//! callers were composed with, and its effects and mesh access fit inside
//! theirs. A stateless callee may change its locals freely. A stateful
//! callee keeps `Keep` slots that match by name and type; the others reset,
//! and whether a reset is acceptable is the host's policy. Compiled
//! artifacts are never mutated by a reload: selection is scoped to a mesh.
