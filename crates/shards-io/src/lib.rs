//! Shards 2.0 I/O shards. Native only for now: browser integration (fetch
//! instead of sockets, the browser event loop instead of Tokio) is separate
//! work.
//!
//! [`runtime`] owns the integration with the async runtime, outside any
//! shard: shards spawn their I/O there and poll the returned [`IoTask`] from
//! the mesh thread, through the shared `AsyncShard` adapter, so they work on
//! both schedulers and never block.
