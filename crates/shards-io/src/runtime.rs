//! The shared Tokio runtime and the tasks shards run on it.
//!
//! Follows 1.x (`TOKIO_RUNTIME` and `run_future` in `shards/modules/http`):
//! one multi-threaded runtime (4 workers) shared by all I/O shards. A shard
//! spawns its work here and gets an [`IoTask`]. The `AsyncShard` adapter
//! polls that task from the mesh thread with the instance's waker, so the
//! mesh never blocks, on either scheduler.
//!
//! **Cancellation.** Dropping an [`IoTask`] (which the adapter does when the
//! instance is cancelled, or the shard's state is cleaned up) cancels the
//! task's [`CancellationToken`], like 1.x's `run_future` cancel callback and
//! `cleanup`. The task must race its awaits against the token, and drops its
//! in-flight work when it fires. Note that dropping a Tokio `JoinHandle`
//! alone would only detach the task, not stop it. Cancellation cannot undo
//! work the remote side already received.
